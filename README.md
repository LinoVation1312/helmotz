## Features
- **Interactive Inputs**: Users can input parameters such as temperature, material thickness, hole diameter, number of holes, and more.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: The app calculates the resonance frequency using the Helmholtz resonator formula.
- **Parameter Variation**: Users can vary one parameter at a time and visualize the effect on the resonance frequency using a graph.
- **Data Export**: Results can be exported as a CSV file for further analysis.
- **Theoretical Insights**: Detailed explanations and formulas are provided within the app.
